# hlmon
Simple bot which monitors gameserver(s) via [python-a2s](https://github.com/Yepoleb/python-a2s), and publishes the status in a Discord channel.

Made for [HL2DM Community](https://hl2dm.community); the formatting is designed to match messages from my [xms_discord](https://github.com/utharper/sourcemod-hl2dm#xms_discord) plugin.

## Example output
